Open the version you are using and delete the folders and file with the matching names in the workshop folder, then add the modified files, do no ONLY overwrite (copy and paste). I suggest making a local copy of the workshop life lessons, so updates do not break the changes made.

1.2 is for Rimworld 1.4
2.0 is for Rimworld 1.5
