Open the version you are using and REPLACE (not copy and paste) all same folders and files with the one provided by this repository. <b>Delete the folders and file, add the modified files, do no overwrite (copy and paste).</b> I suggest making a local copy of the workshop life lessons, so updates do not break the changes made.
